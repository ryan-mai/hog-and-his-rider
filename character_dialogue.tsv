rk	Fame, wealth, and power shall be mine soon.
rk	With my troops, the Blue King won't know what's coming to him!
rk	Hey who's chubby...short? And yellow hair is that!
you	What do I do?
rk	Guards take him away!
you	Rats!
you	Wait hold on!
you	Heh. You and I both have something in common.
you	I think we can work something out! What do you say?
rk	Well if it isn't a runt for the Blue King!
you	What! No?
you	Don't you know who I am?
rk	Hmmm...
rk	I don't actually know.
rk	Are you Tom, Jeff, or Jerry? You barbarians all look the same.
you	I'm Jerry.
rk	I see.
rk	Ah yes, Jeff!
rk	Do you find me for a fool!
rk	Guards call Tom, Jeff, and Jerry take this imbecile away
you	I could never dare to be seen serving a coward!
rk	Well now...
rk	We have quite the bratty snot.
rk	Like father like son, huh?
rk	Farewell... Guards feed this fool to the Pekka's playhouse.
rk	At least there he could be of some use!
rk	However, I have sneaking suspicion of who you say you really are...
rk	How can I trust you?
you	Why would I lie!
rk	Actually I have an idea. Let's play a game...
rk	To see if you really are who you say you are!
you	Ok!
rk	You must know I hate rubbish...
rk	Weaklings...
rk	Therefore, you will duel against the giant!
rk	Please do prove me wrong
rk	Click to Attack!
rk	I am satisfied with you! Jerry, Jeff or whatever...
you	Thank you!
rk	Well now, child. I have a mission specifically for you!
rk	Pathetic. You could not finish the trial in time.
rk	Return when you have some real strength.
rk	What could you possibly share in common with me?
rk	You serve that lowly snot for crying out loud!
you	You jest! I stopped caring about that rubbish king for a long time now!
rk	Oho!
you	I can't stand that mohawk man and his hog.
you	Ever since they became a team...
you	My glory as the barbarian has been cast aside!
rk	I see!
you	So...Can you help me?
rk	Of course!
rk	However, you must do as I say to ensure success!
you	Ok! Sounds easy enough!
you	Wait...I have one concern though.
rk	Save it for later. We don't have all day here!
rk	Get going or do you want me to repeat myself?!
hr	HOG RIDERRRRR!!!
hr	How's your day going Jeff?
ba	Jerry...
hr	Oh that's your brother! What's up with being a downer?
ba	It's been a rough day. Grab me a barrel of elixir.
hr	BALRIGHT!
you	Hey!
hr	So that's your brother!
you	Just because the King favours you more now, doesn't mean you're all of that!
hr	Hey, hey! I am sorry that I am helping our King win for once…
you	We were doing just fine without you!
hr	Hmmm. Remind me of the last time we won without me and my hog?
you	I've had enough of you! How much for the pork!
hr	WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
ar	Ugh. Cut it out the two of you! You guys are such a drag.
ba	...
hr	HOG RIDERRRRR!!!
hr	Who's excited for tomorrowwwww!
ar	And why would we...
hr	Well it's the game for ultimate champion~
hr	How could you not be excited?
ar	Maybe its exciting for you because you actually get to play
ar	We troops are just spectators at this point for the king!
you	Aye!
hr	Hey, the King just sees potential in me that's all!
you	Oh yea? Who would have guessed...
you	If it weren't for you...We would still be on our king's deck!
hr	And if it weren't for me, my hog would have been roast!
you	You would still be stuck here cleaning from our scraps if it weren't for you and that ugly pig!
ar	That's right!
hr	Don't you dare speak about my precious hog like that!
you	Boo hoo! What are you going to do?
ar	Your highness isn't here to save you!
hr	How dare you speak about the king like that!
hr	That's it! You are not welcomed into my tavern anymore!
you	Good! Your elixir taste like crap anyways!
hr	Good grief! That barbarian truly lives up to his name!
hr	Don't you love the warmth of the sun?
hog	Oink oink!
hr	The fresh smell of the sea!
hog	Oinkkkkk...
hr	The smoky smell of bacon...
hr	Wait bacon?!
ar	Hehe
va	It's your precious hog
hr	Oh my RIDERRR!
hr	This has got to be a dream!
hr	Where are you piggy?
hr	This must be a dream!
hr	My precious sweet pie could never be used for bacon!
ar	But it's not!
you	This the king's punishment!
you	Hahaha
va	Do you like it medium rare or well-done?
ar	I prefer it raw!
you	I normally don't eat it rare...
you	But given this is a job well-done, I'm all for it!
hr	NOOOOOOOOO!!!
hr	Whew...
hr	It was a dream...
hr	But I should really get ready for the battle!
hr	Sweet sunshine!
hr	How do you do!
go	Giberrish! Giberrish!!!
hr	That's what I like to hear!
hr	Right piggy?
hr	Wait a minute...
hr	Where did my cute, pink, precious squishy melon go?
hr	I need to find my piggy!
hr	Hey do you know where he is?
go	Gib-errrish!
hr	Hmmm...
hr	That's unfortunate.
hr	Well, see you later at the arena!
go	Giberish!
hr	I know you like to play games and all but today we don't have time for that!
hr	...
hr	There's fresh carrot for you downstairs!
hr	...
hr	That's strange, I'm sure he would fall for that.
hr	Where could he possibly be?
an	Good morning everyone!
an	We are live from TV Storyboard.
an	Let's hear word from our reporter, Jess at the Arena
an	Who is excited for today's match?
an	I sure am!
an	After yesterdays upsetting match 3-2 for Red, things look dicey!
an	As long as the Hog Rider pulls his act together...
an	Blue appears like the clear victor!
an	Only time will tell...
an	Back to you Jessica!
an	I certainly can hear plenty of cheering out there.
an	With one more hour left on the clock...
an	Get your popcorn, or head towards the tavern for elixir because...
an	This is a battle you cannot miss!
hr	Oh no! This is a disaster!
hr	I need to find that piggy quick.
hr	My king and my team needs be down at the arena!
you	You guys think this is a good idea?
ar	Relax!
ar	It's not like we are going to cook the pig alive!
go	Gibberish!!!
ar	Come on are you really going to chicken out last minute!
you	So, what do we do...
ar	Simple, we will sneak into his house...
ar	And then slice his pig into pork chop!
ar	Just kidding.
ar	But if we did, you wouldn't mind right?
ar	Cmon I know you are that much of a weakling...
ar	Are you really going to betray us...
ar	Even after our king specifically gave you a mission?
ar	We have never had that honour!
you	You're right...
ar	Think about the glory!
ar	Isn't that what you want?
ar	You came to the king seeking the very power the hog rider has stolen from you
you	Yea...
ar	And now you can take it back!
ar	What do you say?
ar	Or are you still the same old coward I thought you were...
you	No I am not!
you	But do you promise the king will make me like him?!
ar	Of course!
ar	We would never lie!
you	Ok fine, I'll do it...
you	But that man and his hog make one heck of a partner
you	I don't know about this...
you	If we want to stand a chance against the Red King...!
you	We need him!
ar	But…but what about us?
ar	We, the weak will never be important if we are merely stepping stools!
go	Gibberish! Gold!
you	Must I really
ar	This is not betrayal, this is justice!
ar	Justice against the atrocities committed by the Hog Rider!
ar	Wouldn't you agree?
you	I guess so...
ar	Are you too much of coward to leave a blind eye to this?!
you	Ok fine!
you	I will do it then.
ar	You still seem a little hesitant!
you	No I am not!
ar	Ok then, grab his pig and do it!
you	Do what?
ar	Roast the pig!
ar	The goblins deserve a feast!
go	Giiberish!
you	Ok...
you	But what if I fail?
ar	You won't.
ar	Now shoot.
ar	That's the spirit!
you	So who's going to do it?
ar	You of course!
ar	We will watch over...
ar	Make sure nobody tries anything funny!
ar	Kapeesh?
you	Bahlright...
you	Ah ha, there you are buddy!
hog	oink?
you	Your a lot bigger in person, wow!
you	Shhh, easy now!
you	The king asked me to come get you!
hog	oink oink?
you	Yeah...
you	It's about your buddy
hog	oink! oink!
you	...
you	He's been kidnapped!
hog	OINK!
you	Let's see how heavy you are
hog	OINK OINK!
you	Chill!
you	Relax, it's not like I'm kidnapping you or anything!
hog	OINK. OINK. OINK.
you	You are pissing me off
hog	OINK!
you	Ok fine, let's play a game.
hog	oink?
you	Yea!
you	If you win, I leave!
you	If you lose, you have to do what I say.
hog	Oink! Oink!
you	Looks like you love games...
you	Heh. But this game won't be favourable for you buddy...
you	Well, follow me...
you	Heh...
you	I never said which corn!
you	I had one in my pocket all along!
you	Now stay quite...
you	Heh...
ar	Well done!
ar	Bring the hog to the goblins
you	Ok...
ar	Now, your work has been done...
you	What do you mean?
ar	The king sees no further use in you!
you	This must be a joke!
ar	What are you going to do?
ar	Fight all of us at once?
ar	Yea shoot you scum!
you	Ok, now be quite...
you	Nobody is going to know...
you	I just need to buy some time...
you	There!
you	Now be a good boy and stay here ok?
hog	Oink! Oink!
you	Hey where'd everyone go?
you	Press Space Remember!
you	It was close, but I got the corn!
hog	OINK!!
hog	OINK OINK!!
you	Argh...

hog	OINK OINK OINK...
